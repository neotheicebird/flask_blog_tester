<p><em>Konichiwa!!</em></p>
<p>Okay now that 99 percent of you thought black thread first and then hair strand... :D - both of which are wrong yo! Sruthi thought of the right answer :D  which is - Shadow of the red thread from last week!!! :D</p>
<p>and thats what this email thread is going to be called :) - shadow of the red thread for it has some back up information based on the debriefs from the weekend :). shadows up ahead yo! there are good things that lurk in the shadows at times :)- hereeee they areee</p>
<p><strong>1. Micro Moment:</strong></p>
<p>So the science behind a micro moment is understood by most. The three aspects if tracked in class and enjoyed as micro moments adds up to powerful impact and will help you see the progress you are making with your kids. The three aspects being:</p>
<ol>
<li>Constructive Responding</li>
<li>Growth Mindset</li>
<li>Character Behavior language</li>
</ol>
<p>Soooo here is a really really nice video of a teacher in class having a micro moment with her student!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x43ErjZM_m8">Micro moments</a></p>
<p>Its a short video - so check it out! :)</p>
<p>Micro moments can be a method of tracking the reason behind a reward in class. It can also be utilized to track the improvement through character growth in a kid.</p>
<p><strong>2. Secondary goals in class- Teaching Character in class:</strong></p>
<p>Most of you have heard from Aish and Lana on how they first observed the 5 initial characteristics that we picked and slowly started using activities in class to build and nurture those characteristics. Now these secondary goals should be like what is long thin and black, i.e, a shadow. The kid should not know that these characteristics are being strengthened :). Attached is table that gives really nice examples in being able to achieve these character growth opportunities in different subject</p>
<p>So the the characters strengths that we are focusing on, in the short term is self control and gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>3. Rewards System</strong></p>
<p>Yaaaayyyyyyy! the rewards system framework is now in place and we can build on it! I already see ideation going on, at a different level in the class 7 buddy group!! :D The challenge over the next few weeks is to be consistent with the rewards and the raps, tying it into the character behavior language - micro moments is the tool to do so :).</p>
<p><strong>4. Class Documentation:</strong></p>
<p>All of you are soooo awesomeeee!! by the end of the week looking forward to all the sheets up and running just like the class 5 sheet. A big shoutout to Aish and AJ for having it up and running already!!!</p>
<p><strong>5.Class Strategies:</strong></p>
<p>SO - we brought up twooo really powerful strategies over the weekend! a lot more to come your way ;) the idea is atleast two new strategies and ways to approach class every week :D. So that each of you can reflect on them and try and experiment in class :).</p>
<p>Do you remember what they areee?? ;)  one is Macro Structuree.. and the other isss? ( ppl who attended Saturdays debrief will know :D ) but what about he rest??? :O ... fear not forrrrr!!!!!</p>
<p>ATOMMMMMM Is on the job!! he will be sending you guys the details of the second strategy we discussed on this shadow thread yo! :)</p>
<p>The key is to experiment!!! implement!!!! utilize the platform provided!!! :) - Annette and me had an idea for Macro Structure that can bring everything together :D - more on that this weekend :) - Akhil is playing a key role in this.. thats all I can say :| :D</p>
<p>So have a great week ahead yo!! can't wait for the weekend to build / strengthen and nurture what we got going. YOU ALL SIMPLY ROCK!!!!!</p>
<p>Domo Arigato!!!</p>
<p><strong>Prash</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow through - Dont Follow up - Filarial</strong></p>
