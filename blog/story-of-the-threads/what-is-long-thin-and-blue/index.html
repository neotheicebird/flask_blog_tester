<p><em>Ola Amigos!</em></p>
<p><em>Que pasa! Como Esta??</em></p>
<p>So remember the red thread? The red thread had a dream.. to be a CIA agent! It went through 4 years of engineering school and then joined a secret academy where it trained for a further 6 years! and then it was ready to be deployed. But many people new the red thread :( .. so it disguised itself by painting itself blue! So what is long thin and blue?? not Bianca Blue silly - It is the red thread painted blue!!</p>
<p>Its a silly joke.. but you laughed! Much like the red thread though most of us dream big :) that is why we chose and choose to be MAD. But what about the kids that we are fortunate to impact? Are they allowed to dream big? Which comes to the first thing that we talked about in debrief this past weekend :D -</p>
<p><strong>1. Vision</strong></p>
<p>I want them to! I have a vision for them that when they leave the center - 4 or 5 years from now ... I want for them to be able to fend for themselves and be uber successful ...</p>
<p>but then that is my vision :) maybe not what the kid needs in the short term... what is your vision for the kids that are under you? How do you want to shape them? You have that power! This short term vision for the next 6 to 9 weeks will show you how powerful a change you are involved in :)</p>
<p>But then there are doubts arent there.. what if my vision is not right for the kid.. that is where the Buddy group kicks in :) - collectively across Saturday and Sunday you are involved in shaping the same kids future-- if you discuss with each other/ empathize with each others vision -and put yourself in the kids shoes.. the result is going to be beautiful :). You will see Success!</p>
<p>Annette and her minion mentors are here to facilitate and help this come true :)</p>
<p><strong>2. Lesson Planner</strong></p>
<p>So once we have sorted out our vision collectively the next step is to individually review the math science and English textbooks to put together a list of topics and areas that we want to cover over this 6-9 weeks. Now the vision drives the way you approach your individual lesson planner :). One request is that try and stick to the topics from the syllabus. Remember when you pick a concept the depth to which you go to strengthen the fundamentals associated with it is up to you including how long you spend with it. But if you pick topics outside the syllabus then it will be very difficult to build a continuity :)</p>
<p>Of course it is a suggestion with a greater goal in mind :) if you feel differently all power to you yo!</p>
<p>Remember we ( Eddies / CH / Mentors) will help you achieve a plan that may be out of the universe unconventional too! The rationale though is important :)</p>
<p><strong>3. Timeline</strong></p>
<p>The third thing to put together then is a timeline. This will help organize what you are doing in what week and will also help measure impact :). Each week when we consciously look at the time line we will be aware of how well we are meeting or have met our vision :)</p>
<p>Soo debrief was about the three items that are tightly knit together by the blue thread! they go hand in hand and are our planning tools to achieve something big for our kids :)</p>
<p>Interval!! - As Yencee would steal is email mein Picture abhi baaki hai mere dost :D</p>
<p>So I wanted to bring up an idea with regards to the way that we approaching Zero hour- see if it is feasible and let me know if we can make it happen :)</p>
<p>As part of the last bit of Zero hour- we can go build our class space :) - we have whiteboards that we can use- and if we bring a rope or something we can create our own class castle! :D and then we tell the kids a rule is that they do not leave their castle - because they have to defend it! :) also set up the whiteboard display with details of what is going to happen in class :D ... what do you think?</p>
<p>Either way I was thinking we could use zero hour to plan and ensure our class area is well defined :)</p>
<p>And now we are at the climax yo! :D which is an</p>
<p><strong>Appreciation Corner</strong></p>
<p>Annette and her Minion Mentor Team would like to thank - Varsha / Krithika ( Discover) and Bianca for coming to take class last weekend because we were short of volunteers :)) - Can we all shout out in our minds!! " Yaay Varsha / Krithika / Biancaa ( hufff huff) - you guys are sooo sexaaaaayyyy!! "</p>
<p>Second I love the way Sid is driving the 7th standard team that he was involved with during debrief on Sunday with the concretization ( he is an architect had to use concrete while appreciating him :D ) of the vision and the lesson planner :)
Pick his brains guys ! he is on all the groups :)</p>
<p>Thirdly - Sai and Lanaa You are sooo sexayyyyyy for coming on both Sat and Sunday!!! Love your enthusiasm and energy :))</p>
<p>Phewww - we are at the end of the journey! there is a sequel awaiting us though!!!</p>
<p>Coming soon to an email box near you - The White Thread :)</p>
<p><em>Muchos Gracias!!</em></p>
<p>Prash</p>
<p><em>Follow Through - Don't Follow -Up - Filarial</em></p>
