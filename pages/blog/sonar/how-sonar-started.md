Hola A Todos,

Its been a week of action and brainstorming left right and centre ( Bessie beach, Ispahani and our heads :D ) The GL team has been constantly innovating and thriving to make our kids excel in all disciplines.
We started off with classes , planning, setting vision, character goals and the latest Project Shiken which aims at testing and ensuring the kids have learned their lessons well.
Presenting to you yet another extravaganza "Project SONAR **(SOund Nurturing and Reasoning)**"

"Leaked cables from the CIA, MI5 and DIA state that there have been alien signals detected on various communication lines across the world. An emergency response team is set up and asked to look into the issue, as words such as the Pentagon, Vatican Church, The Taj and Downing street have been intercepted, but the rest of it seems alien"

Latitude : 12°55'31.9"N
Longitude : 80°06'40.0"E

On a secret mission known only to the worlds leading super powers, a drone flies in the sky trying to capture these signals and provide the crucial data which will determine the future of the earth.

Private : Sir, we are receiving signals. All systems are go.!

Corporal : Brilliant, Houston we are feeding in data. Code Red. I repeat, CODE RED.

Systems : All systems are set and waiting for feed. we are prime and ready.


Dei, intha pasanga record panranganu nanaikren da, Enna panrathu. Apdiye ushaar aiydlama.

Machi, avangulukku onnum puriyathu da. Puriyarthukku enna, padikka kuda varathu

......

Corporal : End of feed. Houston run diagnostics and report it to HQ . Over and out.

Elsewhere.....

Technician  : We need a team of linguistic analysts here ASAP. Contact every university and make sure Professor Langdon is here.

Robert Langdon  : I, I cant even read these words. They dont make any sense. I am able to make out the letters....but....but... how do I say it.......


Will the mission be successful ? Will peace be sustained on Earth. Stay tuned in....

This is a similar situation we are facing in our centre. The kids are able to read individual letters but not pronounce them as words and comprehend the meaning. Hence the R&D team headed by Prashanth aka Guruji and Annette and are launching Project SONAR ( SOund Nurturing and Reasoning). From various experiences we have understood that many of the kids want to read, but they are not able to. So they try their best and approximate it to the nearest word that they have come across. This is due to the lack of understanding of letter sounds, also known technically as "PHONICS" .

We are trying to come up with small modules not more than 15 to 20 minutes each and teaching the kids over time. With some research being done we have arrived at a plan which consists of 12-15 modules to cover the basic sets of sounds used.

The team is currently working on,

1. Various methods to deliver the lessons
2. The target students
3. The tracker and follow up plans

Looking forward to making the best, even better. Everyone is most welcome to share their inputs and ideas to make this project a grand success, for the fate of the world lies in our hands....

Talking about joint operations between MI5, CIA and the DIA :D , this project will also be experimented and run with CHI in parallel :D :)

*Signing off,*

Sudarsan , Over and Out.
