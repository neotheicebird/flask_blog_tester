Hola Amigos of GL who either say- *el amor de mi vida and also say - fue un flechazo!*

Annette, Chaitra, Anoorag, Shyaamlal and me would like to thank each of you for such spectacular class planning and following through with implementation this past week and weekend :).

Special shout outs to - Sruthi , Aditi ( who was the first to complete her plan even though she wasnt coming form class!), Badri, Lana, Aishwarya,Monika and Sudarshan ( in love with your systematic approach bro)!!   Anjana, Bouwrna - you guys were soo awesome to come on both days even though this was your first weekend of classes! ( for Anjana almost :D),

A class that stood out this weekend was - Mohan's and Namrata's! - they used their collateral sooo well!! and those boys who never sit the length were in class for its entirety!!

Alrite now down to a little business :D- this thread that we are going to call the red thread ;) is about the *rewards system* that we are going to be introducing this coming weekend across classes :. We talked about it over the weekend- and now know the why and the what!  Now to detail the how :) ;

The good deeds book from last year is going to transfigure into a class scrap book this year. Laying out the proposed framework below. As always each of you passionate folks can tweak it as you want :) a good framework provides the base or a strong foundation on which you as a teacher or a team can creatively build upon. So here goes-

1. Bring simple notebooks, color papers, decorative items, stickers, glue scissors etc to make the scrapbook with the kids.

2. Before making it we are going to pitch the scrap book to the kids- we are going to tell them that this book is to track the good deeds each kid is doing, the progress of each kid in each of the subjects. their behavior and adherence to the ground rules. Next is the points system
     a. Good deeds follow up - once a month - the kids keep a record and let the teacher know during the check-in. 2 points for every legitimate good deed.
     b. When the teacher notices the kid show a growth mindset, character behavior language - 2 points and a record of the micro -moment.
     c. Exit slips- when the kid takes it seriously and completes it- demands points as well!
     d. If a ground rule is broken multiple times - then a -2 is given to the kid. This has to be exercised cautiously but nevertheless exercised. :)

3. As the points add up individually and class wise the following overall rewards are pitched:

     a. The class with highest aggregate score- will be recognized at Dream      
          Camp!!! - they will be recognized in front of everybody!

     b. Each class will have 2 individual awards:
                   1) Epic GMdeeder
                   2) Epic GMlearner

where G- is GL and M is MAD :) - last year this was done was a great success. we would like to build on this.

This should also be pitched to the kid.

Apart from the overall awards- each class you can implement different kind of simple rewards- like stickers , play time ( allowed 5 minutes to wander around :D - yes that can be a reward!)- you could have a hat full of such simple rewards and play chance when the kid earns a reward! Another example- in class 8 Surya Prakash - could get a chit that says " you get to read the Magic Faraway tree with the mentor for 15 minutes ;) ": - he would love that! and you turn what he loves into a reward to get him to perform better in class :)

So the growth card and the tracking of character traits that we talked about is also neatly tied into this system :). So I hope each of you see that there is a lot of room for creativity with this framework! :)

For those of you I have not talked about this too- I will do so over the weekend. Or you can whatsapp me any time! :) Buddy groups - take it away!! in addition to the class plans - please please pretty please discuss this implementation :)
