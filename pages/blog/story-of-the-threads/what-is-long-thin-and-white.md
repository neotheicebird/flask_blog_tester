*Buongiorno Amico!*

**Scene -1:**

The red thread painted blue was in trouble. Assassin X ( so much ass in that word.. snicker snicker) was on its trail. The stage was set for a showdown in the streets of Prague. The red thread painted blue was running.. the assassin hot on its trail... the red thread painted blue turned around and gave a smile and let the assassin - Bang....

And so was created the white thread! did you get it :D - it was the ghost of the red thread painted blue!! :D :D

**Roll to Intro Scene 2**

And that is what this finale is about... the foundation that we have laid in the weeks past will live on way past us :). The vision for a true framework is to create a positive environment and a system that lives on long after the people who put it into motion have left / been kicked out :D / grown away from the system :) - the system always lives on!

So staying true to the debrief of the last weekend I thought I would summarize what we have accomplished in the 6 weeks past. what is left to be tweaked done a wild idea and a climax! :D always go for the juggular we do yo!

**Summary of Accomplishments:**

1. Class Ideation / Collaboration - Check
2. Class Planning - Check
3. Rewards System- Check
4. Sheet to capture- Class Planning, What happened class, character goal observations, rating each child on the specific character goal- tracking progress each week - Check!
5. Buddy Groups - Driving each other and becoming a family - :) check!!

This weekend on both Saturday and Sunday - each and every kid took something special away from class!! Class Segregation- use of white boards display ( final nail in the coffin :D)

Give a huge round of applause for each other!!! This is team collaboration at a different level :)

Interval!! - time for popcorn coke and ice creammmmmm!!! :D

2nd half starts now as you read on! :)

What is left to be done?

So what is left to be done :)  there always is :D - but to be honest the base structure is in place and strong :) we now build on it! so here is a list from a top level for the next 8 to9 weeks:

1. Every class level has child specific goals with respect to curriculum and character ( like Bouwrna!!!! :D)

2. Timeline for each class - that spans 9 weeks - with topics to be covered in each week- Science / math and English :) - Buddy groups take it away!!!!

3. Mentors / CH / EDD ( with a double D ;) ) - Program Level plan to tie in the topic being covered to the Local Text Book to the Activties being done in class. This will help creating a long lasting curriculam specific to GL that can be replicated in the years to come :)

4.a Implement an Evaluation methodology- with an exam designed for the content covered over the next 6 weeks- ideally in the second week of Jan ( Antenna has a further idea in addition to this -she will be explaining it separately :) - it is kickass! - buddy groups this is a beeg focus :D

Start planning for a growth card weekend- when we interact with each kid via interviews to give effective feedback to the kids directly :) - the idea has to be concretized and vetted out - we will use a debrief at the right time to make this happen :)

5. Maintaining the class planner documents and tying in the micromoments from class into the class planning spreadsheet :)

So are we ready to do this shit! shout out a beeeeg yaaaayyyyyyyy :D - I personally think we can do a lot more :) knowing you guys.. but we want to hit all of the above- at least :)  Lets make every weekend that is left a mini Dream Camp ( that is our vision :) )

Phewwww now we are at the climax! as from last week :)

Roll Credits - Finale!
