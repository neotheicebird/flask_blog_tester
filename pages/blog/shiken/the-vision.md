*Konichiwa folks!!*

Master Yoda once said - "Do or Do not - There is no Try" :D encapsulated in this video below- watch watch watch

[Yoda & growth mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inNMktqIkh0)

In essence what Yoda is pushing Luke to do is achieve a Growth Mindset.. Seicho Kangaekata ( I think! :D - I faked japanese by googling- I hope that is what it means :D) -It is something that a few of us learned about as part of a class that we took on Coursera almost 9 months ago,,, a lot of us exhibit it without knowing it! It is something that we envisioned inculcating in our kids this year and for the years to come... :)

What we want our kids to embody is what we are... and true to that, the success that each of you has made of the first big day of Shiken opens up opportunities and angles galore :)!!! So what are we doing

**Short Term**

1. Each of your individual observations and the analysis of the way that the kid has answered different questions are being recorded in the attached template.
Badri, Aditi, Meenakshi and Sruthi are already on it :))

This will be transferred to a google spreadsheet and our in-house techie wizard - TOP TAP will put up the link on our website - GLEEGUE.ORG :)

2. By the end of next week - we shall analyze the data, tied in with the observations. These results shall be published for everyone to see :)

3. What this does is that the teacher will be able to customize their class plans for specific kids.

For example an observation from Gautham on Sridhar - Sridhar is very talented but gets distracted easily. If his distraction level is controlled then his growth will be exponential -  results in a specific class plan such that we are working on Sridhars Self Control ( character trait) - Class 7 Teachers btw identified the character traits to work with Sridhar as - Discipline and Respect :)

On the other hand an observation from TOP TAP on Prison - The evaluation helped me realize that he was dyslexic confusing 9 with P - This can result in a module specific to Praison in every class for around 15 minutes where the teacher comes with work sheets and gives him individual attention :)

Think of all the possibilities - :D More on that in this weekend's debrief :)

**Medium Term**

1. So while we use the data and put to immediate use and prototype with class plans Project Shiken's scope grows :). Badri, Lana ( yaay he is back in a few days after sayin pip pip to london :D) and team shall be working on in-class evaluation / exit slips that match the philosophy of Shiken :) - creative ways of continuously evaluating the kids :)

2. This shall be integrated into the class plans - and will help us study the impact that our classes are having on each individual child. In turn it also helps the teacher evaluate themselves how well they were prepared and about their implementation strategy :) - works both ways yo! :D

3. Class 6 and Class 8 - Evaluation papers are ready thanks to the team :) - and will be executed in class in the next 3 weeks.

4. The team will also work on preparing a end of the year evaluation- the objective of this evaluation will be slightly different - rather than baselining the kids it will be to figure out how much of what the kid learned in the 6 weeks leading up to the evaluation has been retained.. what is our impact :)

**Long Term**

The project scope keeps growing like the growth mindset that we all are inculcating in ourselves and the kids we impact right? :) - as Arjun Gk quoted from Mad's vision - this will put us on that path to help achieve an equitable outcome for these kids :)

for it will help us to continuously analyze, what the individual kid needs the greatest help with and for us to think of ways to provide a framework where the kid gets that help and springboards to a better future :)

So guys - that is what we have started :).
