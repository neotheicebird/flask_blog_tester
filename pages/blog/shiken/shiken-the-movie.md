*Hola People ! Salaaaaam Waalekhum !*

Here we sit on monotonous Monday on our boring dull chairs but fret not , we are G-Leeguers and there is always a surprise in store for us !
So surprise of the week is how our awesome project Shiken is almost going to come out of its cocoon . Booom !

So Presenting to you ,our own GL PRODUCTION : **Project Shiken**

Director : Badri Narayanan

Production Manager : Annette

Plot Discussions: 10th January 2015

**PLOT :**

Once a upon a time a few dull souls , unable to decide what to do where walking down the street , they saw a board which said 'GOOD LIFE CENTER TAMBARAM' , the board was brighter than the brightest of stars and the kids inside filled the life of the silent souls with colors , happiness and fun !
Then started a story with classes, plans, trackers ,dance,activities,boards,stars and uffff , what not !
The classes went on and on and then one of the now bright souls ( called Megamind) wondered whether they would remember what was being taught .
He thought and thought and found an awesome plan .
He decided that it is time that their hard work is tested, it is time to see whether our kids remember what they have been taught , he decided to have an EVALUATION !
He thought :
Since all the souls have  done interesting worksheets and activities for their class , why not pool everything and then choose what worksheets could be used to test your class.
He toiled hard every day ,under the sun,under the rain, collected all successful worksheets
grouped the kids in such a way that out of the 3 kids in the boys team, one of them would be able to help the other two.
He tried understanding the kids from inputs from all the teachers.
first there would be an evaluation in terms of group activities , where the kids will be in one team and we can thus introduce the idea of evaluation without scaring them.
It can be presented to them in a way where they are split into teams in a game show , with a  score board, ground rules  with 2 volunteer souls to help them out ( to have 2 different perspectives while judging the same group).
This is where our volunteer power comes to use and CFR and FR souls can come in to meet our star kids!
Megamind's mind was now too tired of thinking , his brain was getting bigger and bigger and bigger , so he decided to make some other souls in-charge of each class.

Class 5 :Badri(Megamind),Aditi,AJ

Class 6 :Meena,Chaitra,Anoorag

Class 7 :Sruthi,Sai,Shyaamlal

Class 8 :Kashyab,Filarial,Annette,Lana

All volunteers in the respective classes can talk to their POCS  and ideate and create the ideal worksheet for their kids before FRIDAY !
Just when we thought that the movie is over, comes a supporting soul, yes the center support soul who toils hard in floods and droughts and somehow collects  the data of our kids from their school to help us out with our assessment.
He also takes responsibility of stationed evaluation so that the enthusiasm of our kids never tends to zero ! They can move from one place to another to another and finish the game of assessments with their energy still tending to infinity.
After so much of action around , another silent soul is inspired . The soul's name is Atom and he comes up with this idea of adding twists and twirls to the paper, he suggests adding word problems, which would not only test their Math skills but also their English and Comprehension skills.
IT was then decided that first these fun filled,game-show themed activities should be conducted first and after a few weeks a FORMAL EXAM can be conducted for our kids in an exam environment where they will be tested individually.
After much brainstorming, Megamind steps up and says 'ACTION!'
To be continued ...

P.S
So what should we do now ?
To do list :

1. Brainstorm with our grade teachers and POC'S and pick worksheets which suit our class the best.

2. With our valuable and precise inputs, the POC'S can then formulate a worksheet apt for each class.

P.P.S you can use the worksheets from the mail Badri sent yesterday !
By FRIDAY !

And the climax depends on us :)
