Understanding requirements:
--------------------------
The preparation for MAD Lab started with understanding what was required from the session. Since the session was designed to be an eye catcher and not part of the curriculum, there was considerable freedom in designing the session. The following were the requirements we were trying to hit:
Simple, safe and easy-to-do experiments to instill curiosity 
Inculcation of the worksheet filing culture
Incorporation of ice breakers and activities within the session 
Rough timeline for the session:
After this, the next step was setting up a rough timeline for the experiments. Since we understood that we would be given a one and a half hour slot, it would make sense to decide how this time was going to be split. And this is how we split it:

<tr><td>[01:16 to 01:30]</td>
<td>Video session</td>
</tr>

Picking out experiments:
With this tentative schedule in hand, we went about filling in the details. The obvious first step was to pick our experiments. This had to be done at the earliest because we needed to inform people in advance for the procurement of items required for the experiments. General guidelines we followed while picking the experiments were:
Simplicity – Complex experiments involving complicated mechanisms can be difficult to explain and execute
Minimum on stage preparation – Experiments that require boiling a solution for twenty minutes can by time consuming and also might not be feasible
Safety – Explosions are fun to look at but VERY dangerous, especially with children
Delivering a message – There must be a proper take away for the children with the experiment

Materials management:
---------------------
Since there were three experiments in the session, we had close to twenty separate items to be procured. So the required materials and quantity were listed down experiment-wise and this list was posted in the group so that people with easy access to what they had can take ownership of a few items on the list. The list was prepared taking into account the two separate sessions for the boys and the girls, as well as the dry run that was planned to be performed on the previous day.

Filling the gaps:
-----------------
Now that we had a list of experiments, it was time to prepare in detail what will happen in each section of the session so that there is continuity between sections in the session. 
Establishing ground rules:
1. Announcing the grouping of kids and volunteers
2. Explaining about worksheets
3. Safety warnings 
4. Emphasizing the importance of recording observations

Experiment 1: Persistence of Vision
-----------------------------------
1. Intro about how movies work – instill curiosity
2. Discuss theories 
3. Explain how they work with a flip book
4. Demonstrate the “MAD LAB” thaumatrope
5. Remind kids and volunteers about observations
6. Bonus question – demonstrate rainbow disc and ask how it works

Ice Breaker:
------------
1. Ask one kid and one volunteer to stand back to back. 
2. Ask one to pick an object without moving their feet.
3. Ask the other to do the same
4. Explain why it is impossible

Experiment 2: Invisible Ink
---------------------------
1. Ask kids how they transmit messages secretly
2. Give big hype about your new “technology”
3. Prepare the lemon juice and begin writing on paper
4. Restate safety instruction
5. Reveal hidden message using flame
6. Ask for observations to be written

Experiment Based Activity:
--------------------------
1. Introduce the activity
2. Demonstrate activity
3. Distribute materials 
4. Ask kids to show final designs 
5. Record observations

Experiment 3: Acids and Bases
-----------------------------
1. Ask if the kids have heard of the word ‘acid’
2. Explain pH levels using board and marker
3. Demonstrate experiment with five different solutions 
4. Ask kids how many acids and how many bases there are
5. Record observations

Recap and Discussion:
---------------------
1. Recap each experiment and what they did
2. Call one or two kids and get them to read aloud their worksheets
3. Close session.


Dry Run:
--------

Once the final sequence of events have been decided, it is time to verify if they will work. The dry run also helps to align everyone as to exactly what will happen on the day of the actual session. So during the dry run:
1. Volunteers will understand in detail their role during the session
2. All experiments will be tested and verified if they work
3. Possible improvements in the session will be discussed and incorporated
By the end of the dry run, everything required for the MAD Lab session will be ready.
